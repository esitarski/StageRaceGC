# Introduction

__StageRaceGC__ scores stage races for Individual and Team GC using UCI rules.
All tie-breaking rules are applied, and all details are applied to compute the the Team GC.

It takes an Excel sheet with the Registration and Stage results as input and can produce another Excel sheet with the current GC, Team GC, and shows its work for all stages.

StageRaceGC always scores the race "from first principles", for example, if you have a 5 stage race, and a change is made to stage 2, this change is propagated throughout all subsequent stages.

The Input Excel sheet must have the format described in the Input section.  Additional sheets in the input that do not follow the the description below are ignored.

# Tutorial

StageRaceGC creates an Excel sheet showing a sample race with results.  Use this to get an idea about how to setup your own race.

# Input

__StageRaceGC__ accepts input in an Excel sheet.  The sheet must be organized as follows:

* There must be one __Registration__ sheet.  It is assumed that only one category is contained in the sheet.
* There can be one or more __XXX-RR__ sheets,  where XXX is the name of the stage, and RR stands for __Road Race__.
* There can be one or more __XXX-ITT__ sheets, where XXX is the name of the stage, and ITT stands for __Individual Time Trial__.
* There can be one or more __XXX-TTT__ sheets, where XXX is the name of the stage, and TTT stands for __Team Time Trial__.

__StageRaceGC__ requires that the input stages be in sequence from left-to-right.

Column names must match those recognized by StageRaceGC.  Case and spaces are ignored.

## Registration Sheet

The Registration sheet is the main sheet for rider data.  The following header columns are recognized in any order:

Column|Description
:-----|:----------
Bib (or BibNum)|The rider's number
First Name|Optional.  Rider's First name
Last Name|Optional.  Rider's Last name
Name|Optional.  Rider's name, first and last.  Use this field if you don't have the first and last name separately.
Team|Rider's team
UCI Code|Rider's UCI code
License|Rider's local Licence code

All rider data will be referenced from this sheet, even if it is repeated on the results sheets.

## XXX-RR Sheet(s)

These sheets contain the data for the results of each __Road Race__ (RR) stage.  All Road Race sheets in the spreadsheet must end with __-RR__.  The following header columns are recognized in any order:

Column|Description
:-----|:----------
Bib (or BibNum)|The rider's number
Time|The rider's actual finish time, not including the time bonus or time penalty.  Use Excel input format __hh:mm:ss__.  Fractions of a second are ignored.
Place (or Rank or Pos)|Optional.  The rider's finish position.  If there is no __Place__ column, the finish order will be assumed to be from top to bottom.  This field will also accept __AB__ (Did Not Finish/Did Not Start) and __DQ__ (Disqualified).
Bonus|Optional.  Time bonus for this rider.  Suggest Excel input format __mm:ss__.
Penalty|Optional.  Time penalty.  The penalty is added to the rider's time for GC and Team GC calculation.  Suggest Excel input format __mm:ss__.
Sprint1, Sprint2, Sprint3..Sprint8|Optional.  Intermediate sprint points for the sprinter's jersey.  Each stage can have up to 8 Sprint point opportunities, one in each column.
Stage Sprint|Optional.  Indicates sprint points for the end of the stage.  There can only be one of these per stage.  The stage sprint must be indicated as ties in sprinters points are first broken with the number of stage wins, then number of intermediate sprint wins.
KOM1, KOM2, KOM3..KOM8|Optional.  KOM (King of the Mountain) points for the climbers jersey.  Each stage can have up to 8 Sprint point opportunities, one in each column.  The category of the climb (one of 4C, 3C, 2C, 1C ahd HC) can also be included in the column name.  For example, "KOM1 2C", "KOM3 HC" are recognized.  This is required to break ties on KOM points where the number of first places in the highest category climbs is considered first, then if still a tie, the number of first places on the next inferior climb is considered, etc.  The winner of the KOM is considered to be the rider awarded the greatest number of points for it.

### Notes:

__Place__ and __Time__ are treated as separate pieces of information that may or may not correspond to each other.  For example, if a rider crashes during the last 3km, s/he gets the time of the riders s/he was riding with, but the place when s/he crosses the line.

AB and DQ are interpreted as applying for all future stages, and a rider marked as AB or DQ will no longer be included in the GC from that stage onward.  This also has implications for the Team GC if the number of team members drops below 3.

Make sure that AB and DQ riders appear at the end of the list if you do not have a __Place__ column.

The __Place__ value does not have to be unique.  For example, if a group of riders crash inside the last 3km then fail to cross the finish line, they would get the time of the riders they were riding with and all recieve the same value of last __Place__ in the stage.

Column headers other than the ones above are ignored.  Rider information (name, team, etc.) is always retrieved from the Registration page keyed on the Bib number.

## XXX-ITT Sheet(s)

These sheets contain the data for the results of each __Individual Time Trial__ (ITT) stage.   All Individual Time Trial sheets in the spreadsheet must end with __-ITT__.  The following header columns are recognized in any order:

Column|Description
:-----|:----------
Bib (or BibNum)|The rider's number
Time|The rider's finish time including any time penalties.  Use Excel input format __hh:mm:ss.000__ to record fractions of a second.
Bonus|Optional.  Time bonus for the rider.  Suggest Excel input format __mm:ss__.
Place (or Rank or Pos)|Optional.  Used to indicate __AB__ (Did not finish) and __DQ__ (Disqualified).  Other values are ignored.
Penalty|Optional.  Time penalty.  The penalty is added to the rider's time for GC and Team GC calculation.  Suggest Excel input format __mm:ss__.

### Notes:

Make sure that AB and DQ riders appear at the end of the list if you do not have a __Place__ column.

AB and DQ are interpreted as applying for all future stages, and a rider marked as AB or DQ will no longer be included in the GC from that stage onward.  This also has implications for the Team GC if the number of team members drops below 3.

Column headers other than the ones above are ignored.  Rider information (name, team, etc.) is always retrieved from the Registration page keyed on the Bib number.

## XXX-TTT Sheet(s)

These sheets contain the data for the results of each __Team Time Trial__ (TTT) stage.  All Team Time Trial sheets in the spreadsheet must end with __-TTT__.  The following header columns are recognized in any order:

Column|Description
:-----|:----------
Bib (or BibNum)|The rider's number
Time|The rider's finish time including any time penalties.  Use Excel input format __hh:mm:ss.000__ to record fractions of a second.
Bonus|Optional.  Time bonus for the rider.
Place (or Rank or Pos)|Optional.  Used to indicate __AB__ (Did not finish) and __DQ__ (Disqualified).  Other values are ignored.
Penalty|Optional.  Time penalty.  The penalty is added to the rider's time for GC and Team GC calculation.  Suggest Excel input format __mm:ss__.

### Notes:

Make sure that AB and DQ riders appear at the end of the list if you do not have a __Place__ column.

AB and DQ are interpreted as applying for all future stages, and a rider marked as AB or DQ will no longer be included in the GC from that stage onward.  This also has implications for the Team GC if the number of team members drops below 3.

Column headers other than the ones above are ignored.  Rider information (name, team, etc.) is always retrieved from the Registration page keyed on the Bib number.

## Team Penalty Sheet

As per UCI Rule 12.1.021, it is sometimes required to give a Team a 30-second penalty.  The __Team Penalty__ sheet allows you to do this.

Column|Description
:-----|:----------
Team|The team.
Penalty|Optional.  A time penalty given to the team.  The penalty is added to the team's GC after it is calculated.  Suggest Excel input format __mm:ss__.

The same Team may appear multiple times in the __Team Penalty__ sheet.  The sum of the penalties will be applied to the Team GC.

Column headers other than the ones above are ignored.  

# Main Screen
The Main Screen is divided into three major areas:

1. Excel input.
1. Read status.
1. Output.

## Excel Input

Specify your input Excel sheet here.  It must be in the __Input__ format described above.
If you change your Excel sheet, press the __Update__ button to get __StageRaceGC__ to recompute the GC.

## Read Status

Shows any problems with reading the sheets.  It is important to investigate any issues reported here.

## Output


Shows the __Individual GC__ and __Team GC__.  Also shows the intermediate results from each stage.

The full output can be exported to an Excel sheet.

Of course, the Individual GC and the standings after the last stage are identical.

# Notes:

## Team Time Trials

It is up to you to give all team members the correct time of the team.  StageRaceGC does not know how many riders are on a team and which wheel "counts".

## Team GC and Minimum Team Size

__StageRaceGC__ will no longer compute the Team GC when the number of team members drops below 3.  This team will no longer appear on the Team standings.

## ABs and DQs

__StageRaceGC__ treats AB and DQ riders as leaving the competition.  These riders will not be considered in the GC or team GC even if they appear again in a results in a later stage.

Make sure that riders who are continuing have an assigned Time (and Place) as required.
